# BlockHouse-Trial-Work
This repository contains two jupyter notebooks. 
One contains five new features with appropriate visualization and another notebook attempts to provide code for a practical implementation of a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent for optimizing trading strategies. 
The latter is based on the paper 'An Adaptive Dual-level Reinforcement Learning Approach for Optimal Trade Execution (by Soohan Kim, Jimyeong Kim, Hong Kee Sul, Youngjoon Hong).'
